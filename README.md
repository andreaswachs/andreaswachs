- 👋 Hi, I’m @andreaswachs
- 📖 I'm currently studying a bachelors degree in **software development** at the *IT University of Copenhagen*. I'm expecting to graduate in December 2023.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in, but not limited to, all things backend, DevOps, micro services, Docker and Kubernetes.
- 🎓 I have created an organization to contain my school projects that I've created repositories for and links to the ones where I have contributed to here. You can find this organization by name [ahja-itu](https://github.com/ahja-itu/).
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on LinkedIn [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-wachs/).
