- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andreaswachs
- ðŸ“– I'm currently studying a bachelors degree in **software development** at the *IT University of Copenhagen*. I'm expected to graduate sometime in 2023.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m generally interested in anything related to *backend* development, but when technologies like *Vue JS* and material design CSS libraries can help, I kind of enjoy frontend stuff too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a student software engineer at Motorola Solutions, working with functional programming and DevOps. I love it!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me on LinkedIn [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-wachs/) or [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/andreaswachs)
